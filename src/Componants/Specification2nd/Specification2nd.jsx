                        <p className='Specification2ndp '>There are three elements you have to consider three elements while designing your boxes: the graphic design, physical packaging, and marketing of your products. It is a recipe for having the most attractive boxes for your brand. Each one defines your idea in a unique and coherent manner.

                            <p className='Specification2ndp pb-2'>What goes on the outside of a box is just as important to designers and consumers alike. Graphic designers know that it is not enough for an item to be well-designed, but also how this design looks from every angle when seen in person or through pictures online. <br /> <br />
                                The best way to catch a customer's attention is by using a design that propels an idea of the company and its values. Incorporating these elements into packaging graphics will help customers understand what the product stands for and how it can benefit them.</p>

                            <p className='Specification2ndp pb-2'>We now have to ponder on the design limitations of the packaging. Packaging’s foremost role is to keep the product protected. Consider all the limitations and design something blasting within those limits.
                                Designers often look to their competitors in the marketplace for inspiration and ideas. <br /> <br />With competition always on the rise, it is important that you try your best at all times.
                                Looking into how other designers are approaching packaging design can be helpful when starting out because they have already found a winning formula with which others may not compete well against them any time soon.

                            <p className='Specification2ndp pb-2'>Third on the list is how to market your product through the packaging design. Your box design could be the difference between a product that sells like hotcakes and one no one cares about. <br /> <br />
                                Good packaging can attract customers from miles away, gets them to purchase your products even if it is more expensive than its competitors' offerings, and ultimately brings in better profits for you too.
                                Creating a connection between form, construction, stocks, and color with other design elements such as imagery or typography is the key to good packaging.
