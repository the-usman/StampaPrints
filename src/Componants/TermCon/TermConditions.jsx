            Conditions related to Payment

          </h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            Prices are mentioned on every product in USD. If you click on buying a service from us, you agree to all the charges that may include shipping, tax, and other expenses. Processing fees would be deducted from your credit card, and the amount will be updated on the website to save you from the inconvenience.
            <br /><br />
            Once an order has been placed, it will go to our processing department, and you are liable to pay for the taxes, processing fee, and any other charges. No changes can be made to the design files or production time unless notified. Your order won’t be processed unless we receive the full payment.

            Payment Methods

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">Terms Related to Color Accuracy
          </h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            Stampa Prints will try its best to match the color as best as possible with the submitted files; however, the exact intensity can’t be matched due to the ink specifications and printing limitations. However, we give about 90% of the color matching guarantee, and if it’s below that mark, we will get your product reprinted free of cost. However, print jobs without a hardcopy proof won’t be reprinted. For one day delivery, visit our helpline to get a brief on hardcopy proof and other details.
          </p>

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">Design Files

          </h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            The customer is solely responsible for the design files; you are therefore requested to proof read everything before submitting it. Check your Post Office guidelines to get yourself familiarized with the latest mailing restrictions for your artworks. We take the necessary steps to safeguard your artwork files; however, we are not responsible for their loss or damage.
            <br /><br />
            Also, you give your consent to the use of images. You are giving your consent that your artwork files won’t contain any material that would give rise to any criminal, civil, publicity, privacy, and intellectual copyrights issue. We won’t print any materials that promote sexuality or violence.
          </p>

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">
            Production Time
          </h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            Turnaround time counts when your order has been placed, files have been uploaded, and we have received the approval. For next day printing, as discussed above, we need hardcopy approval. If there has been an issue with the file, the turnaround time would again be redefined unless we receive the right artwork. For all the jobs approved by 6.00 PM, turnaround time will count from that business day. We are closed for major holidays and Saturdays/Sundays. These days will be excluded from the production time. The shipping method can also affect turnaround time.
          </p>

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">Shipment Terms</h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            We are not liable for the delays caused by the shipping companies. Also, we are not usually the ones that handle the uncertainties that might result from weather and damages. Faulty files may result from delays that we have already mentioned we can’t be held responsible for.
            Printing turnaround time should be added to the shipping transit time for calculating the exact duration required for the arrival of your products.
          </p>

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">Mailing Services</h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            Your mailing details are our property and would only be used as required and instructed by you. We do not intend to sell your mailing information to a third party.Stampa Prints will fix printing and mailing errors as long as these are related to the printing quality. If you want to change the address, please notify us beforehand. Products fitting in one box would be delivered free; all extra items would be charged with handling fees.

          <h3 className="privacy-heading mainHeadingH2 pt-4">Miscellaneous</h3>
          <p className="privacy-policy-container1 ParagraphH2P">
            Refunds are not made once we have started working on your order, so once the order has been placed and processed, we won’t give you a refund.
